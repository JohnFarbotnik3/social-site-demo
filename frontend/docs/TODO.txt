* idea: Websockets may be used to send 'unsolicited' packets to users containing notifications.

> implementation
	implementing the actual DB will go a LOT smoother if fundamental operations,
	for example deleting a user, were implemented as functions,
	and then have the API functions call them.

	as well as factoring out Set/Map modifying operations seen in friend_xyz() functions.
...

* finish refactoring API_mock_backend, then update API and UI.
