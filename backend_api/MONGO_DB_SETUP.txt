INSTALLING MONGODB

it would appear that the way to get closest to a "portable install" of MongoDB
without compiling from source would be to use the Docker image,
so I'll have to install and re-learn Docker first.

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/

INSTALLING MONGODB - ATTEMPT 2

on second though, docker-engine may not work on this machine,
and finding an install guide for it is rather difficult.
(I'm not really interested in installing docker-desktop).

sources:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MongoDB
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mongodb
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading#Installation_of_packages
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/fakeroot-binary-missing/43646/5

# clone to folder.
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mongodb.git

# install base developer stuff (and dependencies) in order to build packages from AUR
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

# build + install package.
cd "./mongodb"
makepkg -si

> WARNING: building failed at ~10 hours. (filled up RAM then crashed)

# ============================================================
INSTALLING MONGODB - ATTEMPT 3

on third though, lets just install the binaries.

sources:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading#Installation_of_packages
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/fakeroot-binary-missing/43646/5
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mongosh-bin
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mongodb-bin

# install base developer stuff (and dependencies) in order to build packages from AUR
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

# clone and build + install.
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mongosh-bin.git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mongodb-bin.git
cd "mongosh-bin" && makepkg -si && cd ..
cd "mongodb-bin" && makepkg -si && cd ..


# ============================================================
SETUP

note:
by default, installing from a package manager will create a new user account "mongodb",
and the following directories are created:
/var/lib/mongodb
/var/log/mongodb
/etc/mongod.conf

# start mongodb service.
sudo systemctl start mongodb

# if above command fails with error:
# "Failed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found."
# run this first.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# verify service has started.
sudo systemctl status mongodb

# stop or restart service.
sudo systemctl stop mongodb
sudo systemctl restart mongodb

# NOTE: if stuff still doesnt work, see:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48092353/failed-to-start-mongod-service-unit-mongod-service-not-found
# its worth noting that I had to use "mongodb" instead of "mongod" for some commands.

# if it crashes on startup, with error "Failed to unlink socket file"
# in "/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log", see:
# https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/failed-to-unlink-socket-file-operation-not-permitted/208542/5

# start shell session.
